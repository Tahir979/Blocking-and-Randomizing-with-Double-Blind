# Blocking and Randomizing with Double-Blind

> Nowadays most psychology research can be moved to online platforms, that is enable higher quality research designs to be created.

> This program is a **prototype study** that aims to pave the way for **double-blind-psychology-studies without any-confounding-human-factors** in research designs.

> * Firstly aims to automatically perform blocking and randomization, which are confounding variable control techniques used in psychology research, without any human factors (I think that will be useful especially in cognitive studies).

> **THİS İS NOT A COMPLETED-PROJECT!** This program has been prepared for the researchers who eager to see which ways this procedure can be done. For an ideal view, run at 1920 * 1080 resolution and 100% scale settings. After finishing this project, it would be more useful to focus on [Triple Blind](https://dictionary.apa.org/blind).
